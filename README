Start of a long long project
This is a project for a game me and my friends play called summer and winter movie draft. It's like a fantasy football game and you bid for the movies coming up with 100 credits that you are given at draft.

This github is the general structure you will have to get the data yourself I might make the website public in the future but right now it's a WIP. My goal is getting this website working by the end of April.
